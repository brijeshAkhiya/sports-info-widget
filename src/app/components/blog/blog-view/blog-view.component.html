              <p>On Wednesday evening Hardik Pandya was his normal self. He was prancing and dancing around Wankhede
                stadium. And why not. It was Pandya's thundering cameo at the death that put Mumbai Indians in a winning
                position,
                which he sealed with a three-wicket bowling spell that broke Chennai Super Kings' back.</p>
              <p>Pandya's eight-ball 25 was equal to 39 Smart runs, his Smart Strike rate was a whopping 487.50, while
                his
                Smart economy was 1.75. The performance allowed Pandya his first Man-of-the-Match award in T20s in 16
                matches
                (including IPL and internationals). Importantly, it gave Pandya a reason to smile. A reason to believe
                in
                himself having endured a difficult past seven months.</p>
              <p>Pandya aborted the Asia Cup last September after suffering a back injury. That forced him to miss
                selection
                for the T20 and Test series in Australia. The selectors did pick him eventually for the fourth Test, but
                Pandya just carried the drinks. Then on the eve of ODI series in Australia, in January, Pandya, along
                with
                friend and team-mate KL Rahul were suspended by the BCCI for their offensive remarks on a television
                chat
                show, which were condemned in public as well as the India dressing room.</p>
              <p>Although the ban was provisionally lifted on January 24, both players are yet to be cleared. <a>Pandya
                  has
                  been asked by the BCCI ombudsman</a> to be present for an in-person hearing on April 9.</p>
              <p>Evidently, then, Pandya was thrilled at having been the catalyst in Mumbai's victory. "It feels pretty
                good
                to having helped the team to win and contributed. It is a fantastic feeling," Pandya told Sanjay
                Manjrekar
                in
                the post-match presentation.</p>
              <p>Even without the gentle prod from Manjrekar, Pandya was willing to pour out his emotions of the most
                difficult phase of his career so far. "It has been seven months that I have hardly played games. I've
                just
                batted and batted and batted, and touch wood the game is getting improved. I am someone who wants to
                improve
                day by day. That is something I was focusing all that time I was out. Touch wood it is helping me. It is
                a
                fantastic feeling when you hit the ball like that and make your team win."</p>
